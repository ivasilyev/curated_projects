    abstract = {ABSTRACT Objective To describe e compare the specificity of IgA antibodies against bacteria extract of Klebsiella pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , and Salmonella enteritidis . Methods Colostrum samples were aseptically collected in the first 12 hours after C-section delivery. The specificity of IgA against bacteria extracts was analyzed by the Western blot. Results The findings showed proteins of high molecular weight frequently detectable in the samples. S. aureus was the most frequently found bacterium in the samples (p{\textless}0.05). Approximately 93.8, 56.3, 62.5 and 60.4{\%} of samples presented IgA reactive to S. aureus , K. pneumoniae , S. enteritidis, and E. coli, respectively. Roughly 40{\%} of samples showed no IgA reactive to K. pneumoniae, S. enteritidis and E. coli . Conclusion Clinical evidence of the importance of breastfeeding for the immune protection of neonates was consistent with the observed immunological findings, since most samples showed IgA reactive against the species tested. The application and development of immunotherapies during pregnancy, focused on frequently detected antigens, could be an important tool to enhance the presence of IgA in colostrum.},

Study Design and Result: It was a retrospective study. The first child was born after 32 weeks of pregnancy and the gestational age of the second infant was 29 weeks of pregnancy and died in the course of sepsis without positive blood culture examination. In the second child, sepsis with the same clinical signs was diagnosed, the strains of KLE were isolated from the blood and from the mother's breast milk: the strains were identical, confirmed with PFGE. Conclusion: Presented results suggest that the source of infections in both siblings was contaminated breast milk. The targeted therapy used in the mother allowed breastfeeding the child.},

    abstract = {Objective: To test the incidence and sonographic parameters of pyelonephritis during pregnancy, and to examine risk factors and pregnancy outcomes of women with acute antepartum pyelonephritis. Study design: A retrospective population-based study comparing all singleton pregnancies of patients with and without acute antepartum pyelonephritis was performed. Patients lacking prenatal care as well as multiple gestations were excluded from the study. Multiple logistic regression models were used to control for confounders. Results: Out of 219,612 singleton deliveries in 1988-2010, 165 women (0.07{\%}) suffered from acute antepartum pyelonephritis. Abnormal sonographic findings were found in 85.7{\%} of the patients with pyelonephritis. Pyelonephritis was significantly associated with nulliparity (46.1{\%} vs. 24.4{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001), younger maternal age (26.3 ± 6.0 vs. 28.6 ± 5.8 years, p {\textless} 0.001), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) (6.7{\%} vs. 2.1{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001), placental abruption (3.6{\%} vs. 0.7{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001), low 1 min Apgar scores (10.3{\%} vs. 6.0{\%}, p {\textless} 0.05), urinary tract infection (UTI) (4.2{\%} vs. 0.4{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001) and preterm delivery (less than 37 weeks gestation; 20.0{\%} vs. 7.8{\%}; p {\textless} 0.001). Using a multivariable analysis, independent risk factors for acute antepartum pyelonephritis were nulliparity (OR 2.0; 95{\%} C.I 1.4-2.9; p {\textless} 0.001), UTI (OR 10.3; 95{\%} C.I 4.8-22.1; p {\textless} 0.001) and younger maternal age (OR 0.96; 95{\%} C.I 0.93-0.99; p = 0.009). Using another multivariable analysis, with preterm delivery as the outcome variable, acute antepartum pyelonephritis was found as an independent risk factor for preterm delivery (OR 2.6; 95{\%} C.I 1.7-3.9; p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusion: Acute antepartum pyelonephritis is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes and specifically is an independent risk factor for preterm delivery. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

    abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019, The Author(s).  Extended spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae remain a critical clinical concern worldwide. The aim of this study was to characterize ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae detected within and between two hospitals in uMgungundlovu district, South Africa, using whole genome sequencing (WGS). An observational period prevalence study on antibiotic-resistant ESKAPE (i.e. Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.) bacteria was carried out in hospitalized patients during a two-month period in 2017. Rectal swabs and clinical specimens were collected from patients hospitalized and were screened for ESBL-producing, Gram-negative ESKAPE bacteria using cefotaxime-containing MacConkey agar and ESBL combination disk tests. Nine confirmed ESBL-K. pneumoniae isolated from six patients and two hospitals were whole genome sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform. Genome sequences were screened for presence of integrons, insertion sequences, plasmid replicons, CRISPR regions, resistance genes and virulence genes using different software tools. Of the 159 resistant Gram-negative isolates collected, 31 (19.50{\%}) were ESBL-producers, of which, nine (29.03{\%}) were ESBL-K. pneumoniae. The nine K. pneumoniae isolates harboured several $\beta$-lactamase genes, including bla CTX-M-15 , bla TEM-1b , bla SHV-1 , bla OXA-1 concomitantly with many other resistance genes e.g. acc(6′)-lb-cr, aadAI6, oqxA and oqxB that confer resistance to aminoglycosides and/or fluoroquinolones, respectively. Three replicon plasmid types were detected in both clinical and carriage isolates, namely ColRNAI, IncFIB(K), IncF(II). Sequence type ST152 was confirmed in two patients (one carriage isolate detected on admission and one isolate implicated in infection) in one hospital. In contrast, ST983 was confirmed in a clinical and a carriage isolate of two patients in two different hospitals. Our data indicate introduction of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates into hospitals from the community. We also found evidence of nosocomial transmission within a hospital and transmission between different hospitals. The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated cas3 genes were further detected in two of the nine ESBL-KP isolates. This study showed that both district and tertiary hospital in uMgungundlovu District were reservoirs for several resistance determinants and highlighted the necessity to efficiently and routinely screen patients, particularly those receiving extensive antibiotic treatment and long-term hospitalization stay. It also reinforced the importance of infection, prevention and control measures to reduce the dissemination of antibiotic resistance within the hospital referral system in this district.},

@article{Gibbons2009,
    abstract = {Acknowledgement of the breadth of T-cell pleiotropy has provoked increasing interest in the degree to which functional responsiveness is elicited by environmental cues versus differentiation. This is particularly relevant for young animals requiring rapid responses to acute environmental exposure. In young mice, gammadelta T cells are disproportionately important for immuno-protection. To examine the situation in humans, we compared populations and clones of T cells from term and preterm babies, and adults. By comparison with alphabeta T cells, neonate-derived gammadelta cells show stronger, pleiotropic functional responsiveness, and lack signatory deficits in IFN-gamma production. Emphasising the acquisition of functional competence in utero, IFN-gamma was produced by gammadelta cells sampled from premature births, and, although one month's post-partum environmental exposure invariably increased their TNF-alpha production, it had no consistent effect on IFN-gamma or IL-2. In sum, gammadelta cells seem well positioned at birth to contribute to immuno-protection and immuno-regulation, possibly compensating for selective immaturity in the alphabeta compartment. With regard to the susceptibilities of preterm babies to viral infection, gammadelta cells from preterm neonates were commonly impaired in Toll-like receptor-3 and -7 expression and compared with cells from term babies failed to optimise cytokine production in response to coincident TCR and TLR agonists.},

@article{Haase2010,
    abstract = {Immunotherapy can be used to induce immunological tolerance by a number of different protocols. During the last decade the ability to use tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) to prevent autoimmunity has received much attention. Many studies have attempted to use immature or semi-mature DCs to induce tolerance in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of human type 1 diabetes. However, most studies to date have used protocols in which generation of DCs involved a culture step in fetal bovine serum (FBS)-supplemented medium which may affect tolerance induction in a non-specific fashion. Indeed, several studies have shown that DCs cultured in the presence of FBS will induce a powerful T helper type 2 (Th2) immune response towards FBS-related antigens which can suppress an ongoing immune response. Hence, this may interfere with diabetes development in the NOD mouse by induction of immune deviation rather than by antigen-specific tolerance. In order to test whether antigen-specific tolerance induction by DC therapy is feasible in the NOD mouse, we therefore generated immature DCs using autologous serum [normal mouse serum (NMS)-supplemented cultures] instead of FBS, and we show that these DCs can protect NOD mice from diabetes, if pulsed with insulin-peptide antigens before adoptive transfer. Our data therefore support that DC therapy is able to prevent diabetes in the NOD mouse in an antigen-specific manner.},

    abstract = {Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative pathogen that has a large accessory genome of plasmids and chromosomal gene loci. This accessory genome divides K. pneumoniae strains into opportunistic, hypervirulent, and multidrug-resistant groups and separates K. pneumoniae from two closely related species, K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae. Some strains of K. pneumoniae act as opportunistic pathogens, infecting critically ill and immunocompromised patients. These K. pneumoniae are a common cause of health-care associated infections including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections. K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae are often clinically indistinguishable from opportunistic K. pneumoniae. Other strains of K. pneumoniae are hypervirulent, infecting healthy people in community settings and causing severe infections including pyogenic liver abscess, endophthalmitis, and meningitis. A third group of K. pneumoniae encode carbapenemases, making them highly antibiotic resistant. These strains act as opportunists but are exceedingly difficult to treat. All of these groups of K. pneumoniae and related species can colonize the gastrointestinal tract, and the accessory genome may determine if a colonizing strain remains asymptomatic or progresses to cause disease. This review will explore the associations between colonization and infection with opportunistic, antibiotic-resistant, and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae strains and the role of the accessory genome in distinguishing these groups and related species. As K. pneumoniae infections become progressively more difficult to treat in the face of antibiotic resistance and hypervirulent strains, an increased understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of these bacteria is vital.},

    abstract = {Background Recent studies on clinical chorioamnionitis at term suggest that some patients with this diagnosis have neither intraamniotic infection nor intraamniotic inflammation. A false-positive diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis in preterm gestation may lead to unwarranted preterm delivery. Objective We sought to determine the frequency of intraamniotic inflammation and microbiologically proven amniotic fluid infection in patients with preterm clinical chorioamnionitis. Study Design Amniocentesis was performed in singleton pregnant women with preterm clinical chorioamnionitis ({\textless}36 weeks of gestation). Amniotic fluid was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and genital mycoplasmas and assayed for matrix metalloproteinase-8 concentration. Microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity was defined as a positive amniotic fluid culture; intraamniotic inflammation was defined as an elevated amniotic fluid matrix metalloproteinase-8 concentration of {\textgreater}23 ng/mL. Nonparametric and survival techniques were used for analysis. Results Among patients with preterm clinical chorioamnionitis, 24{\%} (12/50) had neither microbiologic evidence of intraamniotic infection nor intraamniotic inflammation. Microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity was present in 34{\%} (18/53) and intraamniotic inflammation in 76{\%} (38/50) of patients. The most common microorganisms isolated from the amniotic cavity were the Ureaplasma species. Finally, patients without microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity or intraamniotic inflammation had significantly lower rates of adverse outcomes (including lower gestational age at delivery, a shorter amniocentesis-to-delivery interval, acute histologic chorioamnionitis, acute funisitis, and significant neonatal morbidity) than those with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity and/or intraamniotic inflammation. Conclusion Among patients with preterm clinical chorioamnionitis, 24{\%} had no evidence of either intraamniotic infection or intraamniotic inflammation, and 66{\%} had negative amniotic fluid cultures, using standard microbiologic techniques. These observations call for a reexamination of the criteria used to diagnose preterm clinical chorioamnionitis.},

    abstract = {Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most important causes of nosocomial infections worldwide. After the spread of strains resistant to beta-lactams at the end of the previous century, the diffusion of isolates resistant to carbapenems and colistin is now reducing treatment options and the containment of infections. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strains have spread rapidly among Italian hospitals, with four subclades of pandemic clonal group 258 (CG258). Here we show that a single Italian hospital has been invaded by three of these subclades within 27 months, thus replicating on a small scale the “Italian scenario.” We identified a single clone responsible for an epidemic outbreak involving seven patients, and we reconstructed its star-like pattern of diffusion within the intensive care unit. This epidemiological picture was obtained through phylogenomic analysis of 16 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates collected in the hospital during a 27-month period, which were added to a database of 319 genomes representing the available global diversity of K. pneumoniae strains. Phenotypic and molecular assays did not reveal virulence or resistance determinants specific for the outbreak isolates. Other factors, rather than selective advantages, might have caused the outbreak. Finally, analyses allowed us to identify a major subclade of CG258 composed of strains bearing the yersiniabactin virulence factor. Our work demonstrates how the use of combined phenotypic, molecular, and whole-genome sequencing techniques can help to identify quickly and to characterize accurately the spread of MDR pathogens.},

In mice immunized between 1 and 4 wk of age, a limited establishment of the bone marrow (BM) pool of long-lived plasma cells is observed. In this study, we show that tetanus toxoid (TT)-specific plasmablasts generated in the spleen are efficiently attracted in vitro and in vivo toward early-life BM stromal cells, which express adult levels of CXCL12. Similarly, adoptively transferred TT plasmablasts efficiently reach the BM compartment of 2-wk-old and adult mice. In contrast, TT plasmablasts fail to persist in the early-life BM compartment, as indicated by the persistence of a significantly lower number of TT plasmablasts in the early-life compartment than in the adult BM compartment 48 h after transfer. This limited persistence is associated with an increased rate of in vivo apoptosis of TT-specific plasmablasts that have reached the early-life BM and with a significantly lower survival rate of TT-specific plasmablasts cocultured on early-life BM stromal cells compared with adult BM stromal cells. Thus, early-life BM stromal cells fail to provide the molecular signals that support plasmablast survival and differentiation into surviving plasma cells.},

In this study, we investigate the functional interaction between various colonization patterns on an early colonizer, K. pneumoniae. K. pneumoniae 51-5 was isolated from stool of a healthy, premature infant, and found to contain the genotoxin island pks associated with development of colorectal cancer. Using intestinal epithelial cells, macrophages, and primary splenocytes, we demonstrate K. pneumoniae 51-5 upregulates expression of proinflammatory genes in vitro. Gnotobiotic experiments in Il10-/- mice demonstrate the neonate isolate induces intestinal inflammation in vivo, with increased expression of proinflammatory genes. Regulation of microbiota assembly revealed K. pneumoniae 51-5 accelerates onset of inflammation in Il10-/- mice, most significantly when microbiota is naturally acquired. Furthermore, K. pneumoniae 51-5 induces DNA damage and cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, K. pneumoniae 51-5 induced tumors in ApcMin/+; Il10-/- mice was not significantly affected by absence of colibactin activating enzyme, ClbP. These findings demonstrate pathogenicity of infant K. pneumoniae isolate is sensitive to microbial colonization status.},

@article{Shankar2018,
    abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Background: Hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) causes severe community acquired infections, predominantly in Asia. Though initially isolated from liver abscesses, they are now prevalent among invasive infections such as bacteraemia. There have been no studies reported till date on the prevalence and characterisation of hvKp in India. The objective of this study is to characterise the hypervirulent strains isolated from bacteraemic patients for determination of various virulence genes and resistance genes and also to investigate the difference between healthcare associated and community acquired hvKp with respect to clinical profile, antibiogram, clinical outcome and molecular epidemiology. Results: Seven isolates that were susceptible to all of the first and second line antimicrobials and phenotypically identified by positive string test were included in the study. They were then confirmed genotypically by presence of rmpA and rmpA2 by PCR. Among the study isolates, four were from patients with healthcare associated infections; none were fatal. All patients with community acquired infection possessed chronic liver disease with fatal outcome. Genes encoding for siderophores such as aerobactin, enterobactin, yersiniabactin, allantoin metabolism and iron uptake were identified by whole genome sequencing. Five isolates belonged to K1 capsular type including one K. quasipneumoniae. None belonged to K2 capsular type. Four isolates belonged to the international clone ST23 among which three were health-care associated and possessed increased virulence genes. Two novel sequence types were identified in the study; K. pneumoniae belonging to ST2319 and K. quasipneumoniae belonging to ST2320. Seventh isolate belonged to ST420. Conclusion: This is the first report on whole genome analysis of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae from India. The novel sequence types described in this study indicate that these strains are evolving and hvKp is now spread across various clonal types. Studies to monitor the prevalence of hvKp is needed since there is a potential for the community acquired isolates to develop multidrug resistance in hospital environme nt and may pose a major challenge for clinical management.},

@article{Shon2013,
    abstract = {A new hypervirulent (hypermucoviscous) variant of Klebsiella pneumoniae has emerged. First described in the Asian Pacific Rim, it now increasingly recognized in Western countries. Defining clinical features are the ability to cause serious, life-threatening community-acquired infection in younger healthy hosts, including liver abscess, pneumonia, meningitis and endophthalmitis and the ability to metastatically spread, an unusual feature for enteric Gram-negative bacilli in the non-immunocompromised. Despite infecting a healthier population, significant morbidity and mortality occurs. Although epidemiologic features are still being defined, colonization, particularly intestinal colonization, appears to be a critical step leading to infection. However the route of entry remains unclear. The majority of cases described to date are in Asians, raising the issue of a genetic predisposition vs. geospecific strain acquisition. The traits that enhance its virulence when compared with "classical" K. pneumoniae are the ability to more efficiently acquire iron and perhaps an increase in capsule production, which confers the hypermucoviscous phenotype. An objective diagnostic test suitable for routine use in the clinical microbiology laboratory is needed. If/when these strains become increasingly resistant to antimicrobials, we will be faced with a frightening clinical scenario.},

The emergence of strains resistant to carbapenems has left few treatment options, making infection containment critical. In 2011, the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Center experienced an outbreak of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae that affected 18 patients, 11 of whom died. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on K. pneumoniae isolates to gain insight into why the outbreak progressed despite early implementation of infection control procedures. Integrated genomic and epidemiological analysis traced the outbreak to three independent transmissions from a single patient who was discharged 3 weeks before the next case became clinically apparent. Additional genomic comparisons provided evidence for unexpected transmission routes, with subsequent mining of epidemiological data pointing to possible explanations for these transmissions. Our analysis demonstrates that integration of genomic and epidemiological data can yield actionable insights and facilitate the control of nosocomial transmission.},

Three selected bacteriophages, targeting lineages ST258 (bacteriophages vB{\_}KpnP{\_}KL106-ULIP47 and vB{\_}KpnP{\_}KL106-ULIP54) and ST23 (bacteriophage vB{\_}KpnP{\_}K1-ULIP33), display specificity for capsular types KL106 and K1, respectively. These podoviruses belong to the Autographivirinae subfamily and their genomes are devoid of lysogeny or toxin-associated genes. In a G. mellonella larvae model, a mortality rate of 70{\%} was observed upon infection by K. pneumoniae ST258 and ST23. This number was reduced to 20{\%} upon treatment with bacteriophages at a multiplicity of infection of 10. This work increases the number of characterized bacteriophages infecting K. pneumoniae and provides information regarding genome sequence and efficacy during preclinical phage therapy against two prominent sublineages of this bacterial species.},

    abstract = {Carbapenem-resistant and hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae strains have emerged recently. These strains are both hypervirulent and multidrug resistant and may also be highly transmissible and able to cause severe infections in both the hospital and the community. Clinical and public health needs require a rapid and comprehensive molecular detection assay to identify and track the spread of these strains and provide timely infection control information. Here, we develop a rapid multiplex PCR assay capable of distinguishing K. pneumoniae carbapenem-resistant isolates of sequence type 258 (ST258) and ST11, and hypervirulent ST23, ST65/ST375, and ST86 clones, as well as capsular types K1, K2, K locus type 47 (KL47), and KL64, and virulence genes rmpA , rmpA2 , iutA , and iroN . The assay demonstrated 100{\%} concordance with 118 previously genotyped K. pneumoniae isolates and revealed different populations of carbapenem-resistant and hypervirulent strains in two collections in China and the United States. The results showed that carbapenem-resistant and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae strains are still rare in the United States, whereas in China, ∼50{\%} of carbapenem-resistant strains carry rmpA/rmpA2 and iutA virulence genes, which are largely associated with the epidemic ST11 strains. Similarly, a high prevalence of hypervirulent strains was found in carbapenem-susceptible isolates in two Chinese hospitals, but these primarily belong to ST23, ST65/ST375, and ST86, which are distinct from the carbapenem-resistant strains. Taken together, our results demonstrated that this PCR assay can be a useful tool for molecular surveillance of carbapenem-resistant and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae strains.},

For the Gram-negative hospital pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae , initial efforts have focused on the detection and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance genes and clones. However, with the resurgence of interest in alternative infection control strategies targeting Klebsiella surface polysaccharides, the ability to extract information about these antigens is increasingly important. Here we present Kaptive Web, an online tool for the rapid typing of Klebsiella K and O loci, which encode the polysaccharide capsule and lipopolysaccharide O antigen, respectively. Kaptive Web enables users to upload and analyze genome assemblies in a web browser. The results can be downloaded in tabular format or explored in detail via the graphical interface, making it accessible for users at all levels of computational expertise. We demonstrate Kaptive Web's utility by analyzing {\textgreater}500 K. pneumoniae genomes. We identify extensive K and O locus diversity among 201 genomes belonging to the carbapenemase-associated clonal group 258 (25 K and 6 O loci). The characterization of a further 309 genomes indicated that such diversity is common among the multidrug-resistant clones and that these loci represent useful epidemiological markers for strain subtyping. These findings reinforce the need for rapid, reliable, and accessible typing methods such as Kaptive Web.

Genomes are annotated by a single Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) to provide users with a resource that is as consistent and accurate as possible. Notable recent changes include the development of a hierarchical evidence scheme, a new focus on curating annotation evidence sources, the addition and curation of protein profile hidden Markov models (HMMs), release of an updated pipeline (PGAP-4), and comprehensive re-annotation of RefSeq prokaryotic genomes. Antimicrobial resistance proteins have been reannotated comprehensively, improved structural annotation of insertion sequence transposases and selenoproteins is provided, curated complex domain architectures have given upgraded names to millions of multidomain proteins, and we introduce a new kind of annotation rule-BlastRules. Continual curation of supporting evidence, and propagation of improved names onto RefSeq proteins ensures that the functional annotation of genomes is kept current. An increasing share of our annotation now derives from HMMs and other sets of annotation rules that are portable by nature, and available for download and for reuse by other investigators.

Using a single CPU Roary can produce a pan genome consisting of 1000 isolates in 4.5 hours using 13 GB of RAM, with further speedups possible using multiple processors. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION Roary is implemented in Perl and is freely available under an open source GPLv3 license from http://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary CONTACT roary@sanger.ac.uk SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{SPAdes,
    abstract = {The lion's share of bacteria in various environments cannot be cloned in the laboratory and thus cannot be sequenced using existing technologies. A major goal of single-cell genomics is to complement gene-centric metagenomic data with whole-genome assemblies of uncultivated organisms. Assembly of single-cell data is challenging because of highly non-uniform read coverage as well as elevated levels of sequencing errors and chimeric reads. We describe SPAdes, a new assembler for both single-cell and standard (multicell) assembly, and demonstrate that it improves on the recently released E+V-SC assembler (specialized for single-cell data) and on popular assemblers Velvet and SoapDeNovo (for multicell data). SPAdes generates single-cell assemblies, providing information about genomes of uncultivatable bacteria that vastly exceeds what may be obtained via traditional metagenomics studies. SPAdes is available online ( http://bioinf.spbau.ru/spades ). It is distributed as open source software.},

@article{SRST2,
    abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Inouye et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. Rapid molecular typing of bacterial pathogens is critical for public health epidemiology, surveillance and infection control, yet routine use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) for these purposes poses significant challenges. Here we present SRST2, a read mapping-based tool for fast and accurate detection of genes, alleles and multi-locus sequence types (MLST) from WGS data. Using {\textgreater} 900 genomes from common pathogens, we show SRST2 is highly accurate and outperforms assembly-based methods in terms of both gene detection and allele assignment. We include validation of SRST2 within a public health laboratory, and demonstrate its use for microbial genome surveillance in the hospital setting. In the face of rising threats of antimicrobial resistance and emerging virulence among bacterial pathogens, SRST2 represents a powerful tool for rapidly extracting clinically useful information from raw WGS data.},

@article{Trimmomatic,
    abstract = {MOTIVATION Although many next-generation sequencing (NGS) read preprocessing tools already existed, we could not find any tool or combination of tools that met our requirements in terms of flexibility, correct handling of paired-end data and high performance. We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data. RESULTS The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested.
