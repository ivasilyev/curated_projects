    abstract = {Enterobacteriaceae are among the first colonizers of neonate intestine. Members of this family, such as Escherichia and Klebsiella, are considered pathobionts and as such are capable of inducing local and systemic disease under specific colonization circumstances. Interplay between developing microbiota and pathogenic function of pathobionts are poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the functional interaction between various colonization patterns on an early colonizer, K. pneumoniae. K. pneumoniae 51-5 was isolated from stool of a healthy, premature infant, and found to contain the genotoxin island pks associated with development of colorectal cancer. Using intestinal epithelial cells, macrophages, and primary splenocytes, we demonstrate K. pneumoniae 51-5 upregulates expression of proinflammatory genes in vitro. Gnotobiotic experiments in Il10-/- mice demonstrate the neonate isolate induces intestinal inflammation in vivo, with increased expression of proinflammatory genes. Regulation of microbiota assembly revealed K. pneumoniae 51-5 accelerates onset of inflammation in Il10-/- mice, most significantly when microbiota is naturally acquired. Furthermore, K. pneumoniae 51-5 induces DNA damage and cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, K. pneumoniae 51-5 induced tumors in ApcMin/+; Il10-/- mice was not significantly affected by absence of colibactin activating enzyme, ClbP. These findings demonstrate pathogenicity of infant K. pneumoniae isolate is sensitive to microbial colonization status.},

    abstract = {Objective: The aim of the analysis was to present two cases of a late onset sepsis (LOS) caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae (KLE) recognized in prematurely delivered siblings, born within the interval of one year. Study Design and Result: It was a retrospective study. The first child was born after 32 weeks of pregnancy and the gestational age of the second infant was 29 weeks of pregnancy and died in the course of sepsis without positive blood culture examination. In the second child, sepsis with the same clinical signs was diagnosed, the strains of KLE were isolated from the blood and from the mother's breast milk: the strains were identical, confirmed with PFGE. Conclusion: Presented results suggest that the source of infections in both siblings was contaminated breast milk. The targeted therapy used in the mother allowed breastfeeding the child.},

    abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019, The Author(s).  Extended spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae remain a critical clinical concern worldwide. The aim of this study was to characterize ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae detected within and between two hospitals in uMgungundlovu district, South Africa, using whole genome sequencing (WGS). An observational period prevalence study on antibiotic-resistant ESKAPE (i.e. Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.) bacteria was carried out in hospitalized patients during a two-month period in 2017. Rectal swabs and clinical specimens were collected from patients hospitalized and were screened for ESBL-producing, Gram-negative ESKAPE bacteria using cefotaxime-containing MacConkey agar and ESBL combination disk tests. Nine confirmed ESBL-K. pneumoniae isolated from six patients and two hospitals were whole genome sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform. Genome sequences were screened for presence of integrons, insertion sequences, plasmid replicons, CRISPR regions, resistance genes and virulence genes using different software tools. Of the 159 resistant Gram-negative isolates collected, 31 (19.50{\%}) were ESBL-producers, of which, nine (29.03{\%}) were ESBL-K. pneumoniae. The nine K. pneumoniae isolates harboured several $\beta$-lactamase genes, including bla CTX-M-15 , bla TEM-1b , bla SHV-1 , bla OXA-1 concomitantly with many other resistance genes e.g. acc(6′)-lb-cr, aadAI6, oqxA and oqxB that confer resistance to aminoglycosides and/or fluoroquinolones, respectively. Three replicon plasmid types were detected in both clinical and carriage isolates, namely ColRNAI, IncFIB(K), IncF(II). Sequence type ST152 was confirmed in two patients (one carriage isolate detected on admission and one isolate implicated in infection) in one hospital. In contrast, ST983 was confirmed in a clinical and a carriage isolate of two patients in two different hospitals. Our data indicate introduction of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates into hospitals from the community. We also found evidence of nosocomial transmission within a hospital and transmission between different hospitals. The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated cas3 genes were further detected in two of the nine ESBL-KP isolates. This study showed that both district and tertiary hospital in uMgungundlovu District were reservoirs for several resistance determinants and highlighted the necessity to efficiently and routinely screen patients, particularly those receiving extensive antibiotic treatment and long-term hospitalization stay. It also reinforced the importance of infection, prevention and control measures to reduce the dissemination of antibiotic resistance within the hospital referral system in this district.},

@article{Martin2018,
    abstract = {Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative pathogen that has a large accessory genome of plasmids and chromosomal gene loci. This accessory genome divides K. pneumoniae strains into opportunistic, hypervirulent, and multidrug-resistant groups and separates K. pneumoniae from two closely related species, K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae. Some strains of K. pneumoniae act as opportunistic pathogens, infecting critically ill and immunocompromised patients. These K. pneumoniae are a common cause of health-care associated infections including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections. K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae are often clinically indistinguishable from opportunistic K. pneumoniae. Other strains of K. pneumoniae are hypervirulent, infecting healthy people in community settings and causing severe infections including pyogenic liver abscess, endophthalmitis, and meningitis. A third group of K. pneumoniae encode carbapenemases, making them highly antibiotic resistant. These strains act as opportunists but are exceedingly difficult to treat. All of these groups of K. pneumoniae and related species can colonize the gastrointestinal tract, and the accessory genome may determine if a colonizing strain remains asymptomatic or progresses to cause disease. This review will explore the associations between colonization and infection with opportunistic, antibiotic-resistant, and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae strains and the role of the accessory genome in distinguishing these groups and related species. As K. pneumoniae infections become progressively more difficult to treat in the face of antibiotic resistance and hypervirulent strains, an increased understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of these bacteria is vital.},

@article{Shankar2018,
    abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 The Author(s). Background: Hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) causes severe community acquired infections, predominantly in Asia. Though initially isolated from liver abscesses, they are now prevalent among invasive infections such as bacteraemia. There have been no studies reported till date on the prevalence and characterisation of hvKp in India. The objective of this study is to characterise the hypervirulent strains isolated from bacteraemic patients for determination of various virulence genes and resistance genes and also to investigate the difference between healthcare associated and community acquired hvKp with respect to clinical profile, antibiogram, clinical outcome and molecular epidemiology. Results: Seven isolates that were susceptible to all of the first and second line antimicrobials and phenotypically identified by positive string test were included in the study. They were then confirmed genotypically by presence of rmpA and rmpA2 by PCR. Among the study isolates, four were from patients with healthcare associated infections; none were fatal. All patients with community acquired infection possessed chronic liver disease with fatal outcome. Genes encoding for siderophores such as aerobactin, enterobactin, yersiniabactin, allantoin metabolism and iron uptake were identified by whole genome sequencing. Five isolates belonged to K1 capsular type including one K. quasipneumoniae. None belonged to K2 capsular type. Four isolates belonged to the international clone ST23 among which three were health-care associated and possessed increased virulence genes. Two novel sequence types were identified in the study; K. pneumoniae belonging to ST2319 and K. quasipneumoniae belonging to ST2320. Seventh isolate belonged to ST420. Conclusion: This is the first report on whole genome analysis of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae from India. The novel sequence types described in this study indicate that these strains are evolving and hvKp is now spread across various clonal types. Studies to monitor the prevalence of hvKp is needed since there is a potential for the community acquired isolates to develop multidrug resistance in hospital environme nt and may pose a major challenge for clinical management.},

@article{Onori2015,
    abstract = {Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most important causes of nosocomial infections worldwide. After the spread of strains resistant to beta-lactams at the end of the previous century, the diffusion of isolates resistant to carbapenems and colistin is now reducing treatment options and the containment of infections. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strains have spread rapidly among Italian hospitals, with four subclades of pandemic clonal group 258 (CG258). Here we show that a single Italian hospital has been invaded by three of these subclades within 27 months, thus replicating on a small scale the “Italian scenario.” We identified a single clone responsible for an epidemic outbreak involving seven patients, and we reconstructed its star-like pattern of diffusion within the intensive care unit. This epidemiological picture was obtained through phylogenomic analysis of 16 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates collected in the hospital during a 27-month period, which were added to a database of 319 genomes representing the available global diversity of K. pneumoniae strains. Phenotypic and molecular assays did not reveal virulence or resistance determinants specific for the outbreak isolates. Other factors, rather than selective advantages, might have caused the outbreak. Finally, analyses allowed us to identify a major subclade of CG258 composed of strains bearing the yersiniabactin virulence factor. Our work demonstrates how the use of combined phenotypic, molecular, and whole-genome sequencing techniques can help to identify quickly and to characterize accurately the spread of MDR pathogens.},
