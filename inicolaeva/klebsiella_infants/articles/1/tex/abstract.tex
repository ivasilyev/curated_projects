\section*{Abstract}\label{sec:abstract}

Since the spread of \gls{mdrkp} strains is considered as a challenge for patients with weakened or suppressed immunity,
the emergence of isolates carrying determinants of hyper virulent phenotype in addition may become a serious
problem even for healthy individuals.
The aim of this study was an investigation of non-outbreak \gls{kpne} emergence occurred in early 2017
at maternity hospital of Kazan, Russia.
Ten bacterial isolates demonstrating multiple drug resistance phenotype were collected from eight
healthy term breastfed neonates, observing at maternity hospital of Kazan, Russia.
All the infants and their mothers were dismissed without symptoms or complains, in satisfactory
condition.
\Gls{wgs} sequencing was performed with the purpose to track down a possible spread source(s) and
obtain a detailed information about resistance determinants and pathogenic potential of the
collected isolates.
Microdilution tests have confirmed production of \glspl{esbl} and resistance to aminoglycoside, \betalactam,
fluoroquinolone, sulfonamide, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim and fosfomycin antibiotics and \textit{Klebsiella} phage.
The \gls{wgs} analysis has revealed genes of resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides,
sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and trimethoprim and \gls{esbl} determinants.
The pangenome analysis had split the isolates into two phylogenetic clades.
The first, more heterogeneous clade, was represented by 5 isolates with 4 different \glspl{mlst}.
The second group contained 5 isolates from infants born vaginally with the single \gls{mlst}, ST23, positive for
genes corresponding to hyper virulent phenotype: yersiniabactin, aerobactin, salmochelin, colibactin, hypermucoidy
determinants, specific alleles of K- and O-antigens.
The source of the \gls{mdrkp} spread was not defined.
However, the studying infected infants were capable to lessen the severity of disease to
asymptomatic carriage.
