\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

The emergence and spread of hyper virulent \gls{kpne} carrying multi drug resistance genes in a hospital setting
have constant dangerous context.
The demonstrated phenomenon of silent carriage of ``normal'' and hyper virulent \gls{kpne} strains within gut microbiome
of healthy term neonates may indicate the successful production of the required antibodies by a maternal organism.
It is possible after immunisation occurred definitely before the childbirth~--- in a maternity hospital or even earlier.
