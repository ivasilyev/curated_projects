\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

The emergence and spread of hyper virulent \gls{kpne} carrying multi drug resistance genes in a hospital setting
have constant dangerous context.
We've demonstrated a phenomenon of silent carriage of two \gls{kpne} strain groups within gut microbiome
of healthy term neonates~--- more divergent ``normal'' group with multiple possible transmission paths and
less divergent hyper virulent strains with a single possible source.
An undeveloped infant infection may indicate the successful production of the required antibodies by a maternal
organism.
It is possible after immunisation occurred definitely before the childbirth~--- in a maternity hospital or even earlier.
Retrospectively, no infection source has been declared by the hospital personnel after a time.
