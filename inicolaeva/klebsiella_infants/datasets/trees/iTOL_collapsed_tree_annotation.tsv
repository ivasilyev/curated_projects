Klebsiella pneumoniae	21-FEB-2017	 The genome sequence of K. pneumoniae strain YH43 was determined using 454 GS FLX Titanium system. A total of 524,416 single-end reads (218 Mb) and 142,440 8-kb paired-end reads (46 Mb) were assembled with GS Assembler software version 2.6 into one scaffold containing 58 gaps. The finishing was first performed by in silico analysis using GenoFinisher software (http://www.ige.tohoku.ac.jp/joho/gf_e/) and then remaining gaps were closed by sequencing of gap-spanning PCR products using an ABI3130xl DNA sequencer. To correct sequence error by resequencing of YH43 genome, a paired-end library of YH43 was constructed using the TruSeq DNA Sample Prep kit and sequenced by the Illumina MiSeq platform (2x150 bp). The mapping of obtained 2,085,021 reads (626 Mb) to YH43 genome sequence and the SNPs-calling were performed using BWAand SAMtools, respectively. Total 38 in-dels were corrected by the resequencing. The gene identification and annotation were conducted by the Microbial Genome Annotation Pipeline (MiGAP). 	YH43	GCF_001548315.1	ASM154831v1
