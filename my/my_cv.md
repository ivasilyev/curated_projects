    * Setup and administration of various free shared game servers (Lineage 2, World of Warcraft, Counter-Strike 1.6), file exchange services, torrent trackers etc.
    * Stack: Java, HTML, PHP, MySQL, Windows

  * Graduate projects
    * 2011 - Bioinformatic analysis and profiling of pathogenetic propertes of Pseudomonas syringae, a plant infection agent. 
      * Abstract: A notorious human pathogen, Yersinia pestis may utilize some parts of its pathogenetic potential after activation through quorum sensing mechanics. Some of these genetic determinants were common with P. syringae responsible for infections of plants across Solanaceae family. The bacteria pathogenetic and cold resistance profiles were also reported as based on quorum sensing. 
      * Stack: HTML, JavaScript (pure) for mostly manual NCBI web scraping, PHP, Visual Basic and command line scripts (Windows) for simple automation

      * Fate: The project was defended successfully

    * 2013 - A possible application of pigments produced by Agreia bicolorata AC1375 as fuel dyes
      * Abstract: A coryneform actinobacteria Agreia bicolorata AC1375 was previously reported as a prospective producer of large amounts of red, orange and yellow pigments which have distinct optical properties. This makes it applicable for dyeing of fuels and organic liquids. 
      * Stack: Bacteria culturing, Spectrophotometry, Pigment extraction, Ames test (based on Salmonella typhimurium TA100)
      * Affiliation: Kazan Federal University, the Institute of Fundamental Medicine and Biology, Kazan, Russia
      * Fate: The project was defended successfully

* 2013 - 2015 Postgraduate Specialist / PhD Student at Kazan Federal University
